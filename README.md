# What-To-Watch
A sample app that displays movies using The Movie Database (TMDb) API

This was the first Swift project I have made on my own while under a time crunch (one week). 
While not a complete project, I do believe it decently showcases my understanding of mobile developement as of Feb 2019.

**Features**
- Consumption of Rest API data
- Data Modeling
- Navigation

**Challenges/Areas of Improvement**
- UI: The project assignment was fairly open ended with minimal specifications as to how the UI should look, and how I should build it. Half of the UI is built with storyboard, the other half in code.
- UX: I neglected to provide loading indicators, which made the use of the app fairly confusing if service is unavailable
- Time Management: Developing the user interface ate up a lot of my time with this project, mainly because I did not have a set idea in mind. I am learning to appreciate planning an app and making mock ups before diving in.
